# fun

Fun or stupid things. Or both.

This is where I decided to post random unworthy stuff,
while hoping to get help with some minor bookkeeping by git.

## Self-induced branching rule

'empty' branch is there to start a new thing from, and should always be kept
empty as name suggests.
Otherwise I may end up clogging my hard drive if enough stupid things pile up.
